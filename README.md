This is a simple store management system that allows employees to process sales requests and check in, as well as check out from their shift.

# Introduction
Welcome to Store AI! I will be your guide in navigating through Bruno Store, your one-stop-shop for all your goods.  
Our store operational hours are from 8 AM to 8 PM.

Store AI has three portals depending on the user's clearance, which are:
- Sales Portal
- Attendance Portal
- Admin Portal

## Sales Portal
This portal allows users to process sales requests as well as view product inventory. 
It should be noted that this portal can only be accessed during operational hours.

## Attendance Portal
This portal is for seamless and hassle-free employees' clock-ins and clock-outs before and after their shift.  
Employees have access to this portal 30 minutes before the start of the day and 30 minutes after the end of the day.

## Admin Portal
This is the backend of the AI. It can only be accessed by users with admin privileges.
There are no time restrictions.  
This portal performs the following functions:
- View sales data
- Calculate employee's daily wages
- Calculate sales profitability
- Calculate tips from sales
- Update product list
- Maintain and assign admin privileges (Only by master admin)  
Lest I forget, the password is *Bruno*
